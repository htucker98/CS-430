CS430 - A5 - Z-buffer Rendering

Language: Java 11
OS: macOS Mojave 10.14.16

Complile/Execution Notes:
Use makefile and run CG_hw5 shell script

Notes: For some reason my z-values are not correct. I do not know why, hence I get some really off image which still gives the impression of the shape. I believe I did implement the correct algorithm for zbuffering and wrote code to process different color channels and files. Since my z values are wrong, to see that I did in fact implement a semi working z-buffering algorithm run tests with the bound-cow.smf
